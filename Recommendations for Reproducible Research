1.  Release Your Code and Data

    For reproducibility, the absolute minimal requirements are that code and data are released. Without available code and data, 
    your research is not reproducible

2.  Document Everything
    
    The first day a scientist steps into a lab, theyâ€™re told to keep a lab notebook. Sadly, this good practice is often abandoned 
    by researchers in computing. Releasing code and data is the minimal requirement for reproducibility, but extensive documentation
    is an important component of reproducibility, too. To fully reproduce a study, each step of analysis must be described in much more
    detail than can be accomplished in a scholarly article. Thus, additional documentation is essential for reproducibility.

3.  Make Figures and Statistics the Results of Scripts
    
    Writing scripts to produce images and tables may seem like a more time-consuming process than generating these interactively 
    in Excel or R.
   
4.  Use Code as Documentation
